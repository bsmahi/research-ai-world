# Mixture-of-Agents: Enhancing Large Language Model Capabilities (2024)

**Authors**: Together AI & Others

## 📝 Summary
This paper proposes the **Mixture-of-Agents (MoA)** methodology, demonstrating that a collaborative system of multiple LLMs can achieve performance superior to any single model in the system. It leverages the "collaborativeness" of LLMs—their ability to improve their own responses when presented with outputs from other models.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Layered Architecture**: Agents are arranged in layers, where agents in the next layer take inputs from all agents in the previous layer.
- **Collaborativeness**: The phenomenon where an LLM generates better output when conditioned on good responses from other models.
- **Performance**: MoA achieved state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0, surpassing GPT-4o in certain configurations.
