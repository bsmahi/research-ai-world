# Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey (2024)

**Authors**: Yunfan Gao et al.

## 📝 Summary
A comprehensive survey detailing the evolution of Receiver-Augmented Generation (RAG). It categorizes RAG systems into **Naive RAG**, **Advanced RAG**, and **Modular RAG**, providing a roadmap of the technologies and evaluation methods used to enhance LLMs with external knowledge.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Naive RAG**: Simple "Retrieve-Read" process.
- **Advanced RAG**: Includes pre-retrieval (query rewriting) and post-retrieval (re-ranking) optimization.
- **Modular RAG**: flexible modules for retrieval, memory, and generation that can be orchestrated dynamically.
- **RAG vs Fine-Tuning**: Comparative analysis of when to use which.
