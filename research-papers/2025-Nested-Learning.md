## Abstract
This paper introduces **Nested Learning (NL)**, a new paradigm that reframes machine learning models as a system of nested, multi-level optimization problems. Each level in this hierarchy operates with its own "context flow" and update frequency. The authors argue that traditional deep learning architectures, despite their stacked layers, essentially function by compressing their context flow, which they term "The Illusion of Deep Learning Architecture".

## Key Insights
- **Nested Optimization:** Models are viewed as nested optimization loops rather than just stacked layers of computation.
- **Context Flow:** Each level has a distinct context flow, and traditional architectures tend to compress this flow, potentially limiting their capability.
- **Update Frequency:** Different levels of the nested system update at different frequencies, allowing for multi-scale learning.
- **Paradigm Shift:** Challenges the conventional view of "depth" in deep learning, suggesting that the true power lies in the nested structure of learning processes.
