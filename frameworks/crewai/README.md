**CrewAI** is a framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. By fostering collaborative intelligence, CrewAI empowers agents to assume specific roles, share goals, and operate together to tackle complex tasks.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Role-Based Agent Design**: Define agents with specific roles, goals, and backstories.
- **Autonomous Inter-Agent Delegation**: Agents can autonomously delegate tasks and inquire amongst themselves.
- **Flexible Tool Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with custom tools or LangChain tools.
- **Process Orchestration**: Supports sequential, hierarchical, and consensual process flows.

pip install crewai
