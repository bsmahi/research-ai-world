# Strands Agents

**Strands Agents** is an open-source SDK derived from AWS internal tooling to simplify the development of production-ready AI agents. It leverages a "model-driven" approach where LLMs autonomously plan and execute tasks using provided tools.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Model-Driven Planning**: LLMs dynamically plan execution paths instead of following rigid workflows.
- **Tool Use**: Easy integration with Python functions and MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Support for agent handoffs and collaborative patterns.
- **Production Ready**: Built-in observability and tracing support.

## 📦 Installation
```bash
pip install strands-agents
```
*(Note: Check the official repository for the exact package name if different).*
