# Developer Cheatsheets

Quick references for common AI libraries and frameworks.

## 🦜 LangChain
- **Official Cheatsheet**: [LangChain GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/CRUMB.md)
- **Concepts**:
    - **Chains**: Sequences of calls associated with an LLM.
    - **Agents**: LLMs that use tools to decide what to do.
    - **Memory**: State persistence between method calls.

## 🐍 Python for AI
- **NumPy**: `import numpy as np` - The core library for scientific computing.
- **Pandas**: `import pandas as pd` - Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.

## 🤖 Prompt Engineering
- **Zero-Shot**: Asking the model to do something without examples.
- **Few-Shot**: Providing a few examples to guide the model.
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Encouraging the model to think step-by-step.
